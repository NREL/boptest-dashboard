Before running `docker-compose up` you will need to create a new directory (probably will add this to the repo itself soon actually) called `pg` alongside `server` and `client` and within that directory you will need to create a `database.env` file consisting of the following values:

POSTGRES_USER={your db username here}
POSTGRES_PASSWORD={your db password here}
POSTGRES_DB={the name of the db}
